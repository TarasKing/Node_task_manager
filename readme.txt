In this project I have practice working with:
- set up VMC environment 
- create REST API, which allow user perform a CRUD operations with data:
    - get: api/v1/tasks - get all tasks
    - post: api/v1/tasks - create task
    - get: api/v1/tasks/:id - get task by id
    - patch: api/v1/tasks/:id - update task by id
    - delete: api/v1/tasks/:id - delete task
- practice working with MongoDB:
    - NoSQL, non relational db 
    - store json
- practise working with Mongoose
